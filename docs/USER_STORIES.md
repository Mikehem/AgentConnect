- [ ] **Given** I export chat sessions, **When** the export includes conversation data, **Then** it contains messages, tool calls, timestamps, and associated metadata
- [ ] **Given** I have large amounts of data, **When** the export is processed, **Then** the file is compressed and organized in a logical directory structure
- [ ] **Given** I want to verify export completeness, **When** I review the export, **Then** it includes a manifest file listing all included data with checksums
- [ ] **Given** I need regular backups, **When** I schedule automatic exports, **Then** the system generates periodic exports and notifies me when available

#### Technical Requirements
- Support multiple export formats (JSON, CSV, XML)
- Include comprehensive metadata and relationships
- Implement secure download links with expiration
- Provide data integrity verification

### Story 7.2: Data Retention and Deletion
**As an** Admin  
**I want to** configure data retention policies  
**So that** I can comply with legal requirements and manage storage costs

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Given** I configure retention policies, **When** I set different retention periods for data types, **Then** the system automatically deletes data after the specified period
- [ ] **Given** I want to delete user data, **When** a user requests account deletion, **Then** all their personal data is removed while preserving anonymized analytics
- [ ] **Given** I need to retain audit logs, **When** I configure audit retention, **Then** audit logs are preserved longer than other data types for compliance
- [ ] **Given** data approaches deletion date, **When** the retention period is nearly expired, **Then** I receive notifications before automatic deletion occurs
- [ ] **Given** I want to preserve important data, **When** I mark sessions or servers as "protected", **Then** they are exempt from automatic deletion policies
- [ ] **Given** I need to prove deletion, **When** data is automatically deleted, **Then** the system generates deletion certificates with timestamps and data descriptions
- [ ] **Given** I want to pause deletion, **When** legal holds are in place, **Then** I can suspend automatic deletion for specific data sets

#### Technical Requirements
- Implement cascading deletion with referential integrity
- Support legal hold functionality
- Generate audit trails for all deletions
- Provide secure deletion that cannot be recovered
